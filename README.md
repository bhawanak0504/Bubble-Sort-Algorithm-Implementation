# Bubble-Sort-Algorithm-Implementation

Description:

This repository contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C++. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort can be inefficient on large datasets but serves as a fundamental example of sorting algorithms.

Key Features:

Bubble Sort Implementation: Clear and concise code demonstrating the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Modularity: Functions are modularized for easy understanding and potential reuse.
Documentation: Inline comments and README file provide explanations and usage instructions.

Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Advantages of Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
It does not require any additional memory space.
It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.

Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/bhawanak0504/bubble-sort.git
